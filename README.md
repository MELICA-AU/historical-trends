# Historical Analysis of public, private and combined (BDG, SR, and KOB) shelters in Aarhus
*ANALYSIS*

MELICA investigates the empirical basis of Cold-War preparedness in Aarhus by (1) reconstructing the everyday experience of individuals living in Cold-War Aarhus through spatial analysis of shelter locations and text analysis of written sources to assess whether the evidence points towards a militarization of everyday life or ‘normalization’ of war, (2) identifying gaps between how Cold-War civil defense was conceptualized at the national level and delivered at the local level in Aarhus, and (3) evaluating civil defense effectiveness by simulating a shelter drill, identifying weak points and stakeholders in civil defense planning.

The roadmap to accomplish our goals combines three research activities:
* Documentation of surviving civilian shelters in the Aarhus kommune, on the basis of field survey and archival data
* Creation of a thematic digital archive focused on the civil defense from materials present in the Aarhus City Archive
* Smart text and spatial analysis of the two archives :smile:

This repository explores the third research objective: historical evolution of shelters over time.

## Purpose
Construct timeseries of BDG, SR, and KOBs so we can reconstruct how many were on the ground in each decade of the twentieth century and how their location varied over time.
